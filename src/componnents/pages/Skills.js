                        I have worked with computers all my life. 
                        Whether it was building PC's for friends and myself, small problems around my parents house, or helping my coworkers fix their computer issues.

                        <div class="fw-bold">CSS</div>
                        I have been working with CSS and CSS frameworks for about a year now. I started using CSS in my Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. I have used frameworks such as bootstrap, Materialize, tailwind, and Bulma.

                        <div class="fw-bold">HTML</div>
                        I also started using HTML about a year ago in my aforementioned bootcamp. Whether accompanied by React or Angular as well as writing raw HTML for all of my projects.

                        <div class="fw-bold">Git</div>
                        I have been an avid user of Github, Git, and GitLab for about a year now. I started using these just before my bootcamp and have been very active on these platforms. I am very big fan of the project management that GitHub offers and the ability to delegate tasks to other colleagues/coworkers. As well as the ease of uploading and updating new projects through Powershell or Git.

                        <div class="fw-bold">JavaScript</div>
                        JavaScript is one of my strongest skills and I love using it to build applications and websites. The ease of adapting to API's, Node's, and Databases makes it very easy and simple to use.

                        <div class="fw-bold">MySQL</div>
                        One of my stronger Skills MySQL is the source database for a third of my projects. It took me a while to get the hold of this database, but I can say that I have sufficiently learned to use this relational database effectively.

                        <div class="fw-bold">APIs</div>
                        I have used APIs for almost all of my projects. Working with APIs can be a little difficult just based on how the API is formed and what can and cannot be used. However, I have worked with Youtube/Google and Spotify APIs to successfully build an application called Media Suggestor.

                        <div class="fw-bold">MongoDB</div>
                        MongoDB is my favorite database lanaguage to use. It makes everything connecting everything a lot easier and is the database I go to most often.
